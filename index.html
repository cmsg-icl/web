<h1>The Computational Materials Science Group</h1>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width = "60%" align="justify">
      The group was founded at STFC's Daresbury Laboratory in 1993. For
      over ten years the main emphasis was on the development of high
      performance software for materials simulation. This resulted in significant
      contributions to the CRYSTAL, CASTEP, DLEXCURVE and OPTADOS
      codes. It also led to the introduction of hybrid exchange density
      functional theory to condensed matter simulations in 2001.
      <p>
      From 2005 onwards the emphasis shifted to materials discovery and
      optimisation often in collaboration with industry. This has led to
      the discovery of the worlds hardest oxide material, new routes for
      catalyst optimisation, near room temperature magnetism in molecular
      magnets and a new approach to predicting, preventing, detecting and
      mitigating materials ageing.
      <p>
      20 doctoral students have graduated from the group and have moved on
      to careers in academia and industry.
      <p>
      Over 350 MRes students have graduated from the Master of Research in
      Nanomaterials since 2005 when Harrison became the Director
