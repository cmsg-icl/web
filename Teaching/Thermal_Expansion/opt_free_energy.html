<h2>The Thermal Expansion of MgO</h2>


<p>In this exercise the structure of MgO will be optimised with 
respect to the free energy at a number of temperatures. The free
energy is computed within the quasi-harmonic approximation.


<p>A free energy optimisation is performed as follows.

<blockquote>

 <p>Load an MgO structure and bring up the <b>Execute GULP</b> panel.

 <p>Click on <b>optimisation</b>

 <p>Click on <b>Optimisation opts</b> and select <b>Optimise Gibbs free energy</b>.

 <p>Click on <b>General opts</b> and select <b>Phonon DOS</b>.

 <p>Select suitable shrinking factors for the <b>k</b>-space sampling
 based on your previous investigations.

 <p>Set the <b>Temperature</b>
 
 <p>Run GULP and examine the log file.

</blockquote>

<p>These calculations will take a little while to complete. GULP is computing
the internal energy and phonons at a sequence of geometries as it seeks
to minimise the free energy with respect to the structure.

<p>Vary the temperature from 0K to 1000K in steps of 100K and compute the 
variation in the free energy and optimal lattice constant by optimising the
structure at each temperature. 

<h3>Questions</h3>

<ul>
 <li> Plot the free energy against temperature 
 <li> Plot the lattice constant against temperature
 <li> Comment on the shape of these curves.
 <li> Compute the coefficient of thermal expansion for MgO
 <li> How does this compare to that measured ? Find a measurement in
 the literature or on the web - at what temperature was the
 measurement made ?
 <li> What are the main approximations in your calculation ?
</ul>

<h3>An opportunity to speculate ...</h3>

<ul>
 <li> What is the physical origin of thermal expansion ?
 <li> As the temperature approaches the melting point of MgO how well 
      do the phonon modes represent the actual motions of the ions ?
 <li> In a diatomic molecule with an exactly harmonic potential would
 you expect the bond length to increase with temperature ? Why does it 
 increase in the solid when we are using an quasi-harmonic approximation ?
</ul>
