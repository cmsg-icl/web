<h2>An Initial Optimisation of MgO</h2>

<p>In this exercise the geometry of an MgO crystal will be optimised with respect to 
its internal energy. 
<p>The relaxed geometry corresponds to the structure MgO would adopt at zero pressure
and zero temperature.


<p><br>Load the structure in MgO.str
<blockquote>
 File->Load Model->from File<br>
 Cick on <b>Browse</b><br>
 Select <b>MgO.str</b><br>
 Select <b>OK</b> <br>
 Select <b>OK</b> <br>
</blockquote>

<p>A model of MgO should have appeared in the DLV 3DView window.<br>

<p><br>Give the current model a suitable name. This will be used as the
label for this model in subsequent GULP simulations.
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>
  Edit -> Model -> Name<br>
  Change "Model_1(MgO.str)" to something suitable; say "MgO".
</blockquote>

<p><br>Note:
<blockquote>
 For the change to take effect you must press Return.<br>
 You'll see the name of the graphics window change to "DLV 3DView - MgO";
</blockquote>

<p><br>Now open the Execute GULP panel.
<blockquote>
 Calculate -> GULP -> Execute GULP
</blockquote>

<p>This panel will pop up;

<br>&nbsp; 
<p><img SRC="Execute1.gif"  BORDER=0 height=328 width=408 >
<br>&nbsp;

<p>As a first step GULP will be used to optimise the structure of MgO.

<p>The symmetry of the crystal fixes the positions of the atoms within
the cell and constrains the cell to be cubic. Thus there is only one structural
parameter to optimize - the lattice constant a.

<p>Firstly we must choose a <i>force field</i> or <i>potential model</i> 
to describe the interactions between the Mg and O ions. 

<blockquote>
 <p>Click on <b>Select potentials</b>
 <p>Select <b>bush.lib</b> on the <b>GULP Potential parameters</b> panel
 <p>Ensure that the <b>Include Shells</b> option is selected
</blockquote>

<p> Now you can run the optimization:

<blockquote>
 <p>Select <b>Optimization</b> on the <b>Execute GULP</b> panel 
 <p>Click on <b>Run</b>
</blockquote>

<p>The <b>Job List</b> panel will open automatically and look something like this;

<br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;
<img SRC="JobList1.gif" BORDER=0 height=528 width=308>
<br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;

<p STYLE="font-weight: medium">Select the job and the status line should
report "Job has completed" - like this;

<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
<img SRC="JobList2.gif" BORDER=0 height=528 width=308>
<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;

<blockquote>
 <p>Click on <b>Recover Files</b>.
</blockquote>

<p>A window will open displaying the output from the GULP calculation 
(the LogFile). 

<p>It should look something like&nbsp; <a href="MgO_0.out">MgO_0.out</a>

<p>Take some time to read through the LogFile.

<p>Note that:

<blockquote>
 GULP describes MgO using the primitive unit cell. Initially
 the cell vectors are (in Angstrom);
 <p>0.0000 &nbsp 2.1056 &nbsp 2.1056<br>
    2.1056 &nbsp 0.0000 &nbsp 2.1056<br>
    2.1056 &nbsp 2.1056 &nbsp 0.0000

 <p>This primitive cell corresponds to a crystallagraphic (conventional) 
 cell with lattice constant 2.9778 Angstrom.<br>
 You can see the two cells using <b>Display->Structure</b>. Turn on
 draw lattice and select either <b>Primitive</b> or <b>Conventional</b> 
 as the cell type.
</blockquote>

<p>In the LogFile GULP reports the structure and the interaction potentials 
that describe the Mg-O bonding and then computes the energy for configuration
1,  i.e. the initial geometry. This energy is -40.99517 eV per unit cell.

<p>GULP then performs a bulk optimisation which reduces the energy to -40.99536
eV/cell with a final lattice constant of 2.9741 Angstrom. 

<p>The change in geometry and energy gain in optimisation are very small.
Clearly the initial geometry was very close to the minimum energy structure.

<p>Note that DLV has automatically loaded the final structure and given it the
name "Model_2(MgO_0.str)".
