<h2>Calculating the phonon modes of MgO</h2>


<p>In this exercise the vibrational modes (phonon modes) of MgO will be computed.
The phonon modes will be displayed as dispersion curves, 
a density of states and animated.

<p>In a later exercise the free energy will be computed
within the harmonic approximation.
For this an accurate phonon density of states must be computed.

<h3>Computing the phonon dispersion curves</h3>

<p>In order to visualise the phonon modes and understand the variation
of frequencies with <b>k</b> compute the phonon frequencies along a 
path in <b>k</b>-space. These are the <i>w<sub>j,k</sub></i> curves
that will also be discussed in a Lecture - 
<a href="https://www.ch.ic.ac.uk/harrison/Teaching/L4_Vibrations.pdf">
Vibrations in crystals</a><br>

<p> The essential point is that <i>every possible vibration</i> of the crystal can be
labelled with a <b>k</b>-vector which is related to the direction and
wavelength of the vibration.

<p>The calculation is performed as follows;

<blockquote>

 <p>Load the MgO structure and bring up the <b>Execute GULP</b> panel.
 
 <p>Click on <b>General opts</b> and select <b>Phonon Dispersion</b>.

 <p>Set Npoints to 50

  <p> Ensure that <b> Calculate Phonon Eigenvectors </b> is selected.

</blockquote>

<p> 
The special points along the conventional path in <b>k</b>-space, 
W-L-G-W-X-K, are displayed at the bottom of the panel. The phonons will
be computed at 50 points along this path. Note that the path and the 
names for the particular end points are simply a widely used convention
which allows researchers to display phonon frequencies easily - it is
difficult to display the variation of the frequency over the full 3D
<b>k</b>-space.

<blockquote>

 <p><b>Run</b> GULP and <b>Recover Files</b>

</blockquote>

<p>A window containing the Log File will pop up. 

<p>In addition a window <b>1D Data Display</b> will pop up.

<p>The phonon dispersion curves  should be available for plotting.

<blockquote>
 <p> Select <b>GULP phonon dispersion</b> in the <b>1D Data Display</b> panel.
 <p> Click on the <b>Draw 1D data</b> button
</blockquote>

<p>The <b>2DView</b> window will pop up and should contain the 
<i>phonon dispersion curves</i> looking something like this.

<p> At this point you will have developed a keen understanding of why
many researchers invest in 19 inch monitors - if you close windows
that you are not currently using it will help to keep the screen
tidy :-).

<h3>Visualising the Phonons</h3>


<blockquote>
 <p><b>Display -> Animate -> Property</b>
</blockquote>

<p> The <b>Create Property Animation</b> panel will pop up listing all of
the phonon modes computed for the dispersion plot. 

<p> Select one of the phonon modes - mode 117 is a good one to start with (the
mode numbers are in brackets after the frequency and k-point).

<p>Set <b>N frames</b> to, say, 30 and <b>max amplitude</b> to 0.2 and 
click <b>Apply</b>.

<p> The <b>Animate Model</b> panel should pop up. Set <b>Cycle Options</b>
to <b>Cycle</b> and click <b>Run</b> to animate the selected phonon.
DLV will automatically switch to a suitable supercell which wholly
contains the phonon being animated (ie: a cell in which the vibrating
atoms repeat once). Mode 117 is at the <b>k</b>-point (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) and
so can be represented within the primitive unit cell. 

<p> In the 3DView window the atoms begin to vibrate - this is the motion
associated with the mode you have selected.

<p> Note: DLV scales (normalises) the image every time it is refreshed which
may cause the animation to jump around a little - you can prevent this by
turning off the <b>Auto Normalise</b> option on the main control panel.

<p> Note that you can examine the phonons at all of the 50 k-points we
have computed for the dispersion curve.  All of the possible vibrations 
of the infinite lattice of Mg and O ions can be computed and visualised 
in this way - we simply need to compute at enough <b>k</b>-points.

<p> In order to compute, for example, a free energy a sum over <b>all</b>
of the vibrations of the lattice is required - that means a sum over all
possible <b>k</b>-points. In the computer this must
be approximated by a sum over a large but finite number of points on a grid.
In practical work the question is - how many points are required to obtain
an accurate answer ?

<p> The <i>density of states</i> is a useful object which summarises the
dispersion curves - it is an <i>average</i> over all <b>k</b>-points yielding
the number of vibrational modes at each frequency (the density of modes).


<h3>The phonon density of states</h3>

Summing over all of the states (labelled by their k-point) at a
particular frequency (ie: vibrational  energy) produces a simpler 
"energy level diagram" for the phonons which is called the 
<i>the density of states</i>. 

<p>A calculation is performed as follows.

<blockquote>
 <p>Load an MgO structure and bring up the <b>Execute GULP</b> panel.
 
 <p>Click on <b>General opts</b> and select <b>Phonon DOS.</b>.

 <p>The <i>shrinking factors</i> along the <b>A</b>, <b>B</b> and <b>C</b> directions
    will be displayed; these simply define the grid of <b>k</b>-points on which the
    average will be performed and default to a simgle point - a 1x1x1 grid. 
</blockquote>

<p> The panel should look like this;

<br>&nbsp; 
<p><img SRC="phonon1.gif"  BORDER=0 >
<br>&nbsp;

<blockquote>
 <p>Click on <b>Run GULP</b> and after completion <b>Recover Files</b>
</blockquote>

<p>A window containing the Log File will pop up. 

<p>In addition a window <b>1D Data Display</b> will pop up.

<p>The phonon density of states  should be available for plotting.

<blockquote>
 <p> Select <b>GULP phonon Density of States</b> in the <b>1D Data Display</b> panel.
 <p> Click on the <b>Draw 1D data</b> button
</blockquote>

<p>The <b>2DView</b> window will pop up and should contain a density
of states looking something like this.


<br>&nbsp; 
<p><img SRC="phonon_dos1.gif"  BORDER=0 >
<br>&nbsp;

<p> This is the density of states (DOS) computed from a single
<b>k</b>-point - not much of an average ! It consists of 4 distinct peaks. 

<p>In order to obtain a smooth curve the phonons must be sampled 
on a denser grid of <b>k</b>-points.

<p>In order to use more <b>k</b> points rerun the the density
of states calculation increasing the shrinking factors from
1x1x1.

<p>Try 2x2x2, 3x3x3, 4x4x4 etc. grids and see how the density
of states varies.

<h3>Questions</h3>

<ul>

 <li> The density of states for 1x1x1 grid was computed for
      a single <b>k</b>-point. <br>
      Can you work out which <b>k</b>-point by examining the
      dispersion curves ? look in the Log File to check. <br>

 <li> How does the density of states vary with grid size ?

 <li> As the grid size increases more and more of the possible vibrations are sampled
and more features appear - which grid size is the minimum for a reasonable approximation
to the density of states ?

 <li> How does the density of states computed at this optimal grid size compare
      to that computed for smaller and larger grids ?

 <li> How is the density of states related to the dispersion curves ?

</ul>

<hr>

<h3>An opportunity to speculate</h3>
<ul>
 <li> Would this optimal grid size for MgO be appropriate for a calculation on;
 <ol>
      <li> a similar oxide (eg: CaO) ?
      <li> a Zeolite (eg: Faujasite) ?
      <li> a metal (eg: lithium) ?
 </ol>
</ul>
