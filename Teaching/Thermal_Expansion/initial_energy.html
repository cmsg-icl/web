<h2>An Initial Calculation on MgO</h2>

<p>In this exercise you will calculate the internal energy of an MgO crystal.

<p><br>Load the structure in MgO.str
<blockquote>
 File->Load Model->from File<br>
 Cick on <b>Browse</b><br>
 Select <b>MgO.str</b><br>
 Select <b>OK</b> <br>
 Select <b>OK</b> <br>
</blockquote>

<p>A model of MgO should have appeared in the DLV 3DView window.<br>
This structure should look reasonably familiar it is the rocksalt (NaCl)
lattice - with oxygen ions (red) and magnesium ions (green) drawn at their
ionic radii.

<hr>
<h3>Take a moment to familiarise yourself with DLV ...</h3>

<p> On  main panel the square icons are toggles which control how the
3D structrue is displayed. A help message is displayed when you pass
the mouse over each button. At first you are in <i>rotate mode</i> and can
spin the structure by dragging with the right mouse button. Try
changing to <i>scale mode</i> and <i>translate mode</i> etc.

<p> Open the <b>Structure Display</b> panel
<blockquote>
 Display->Structure
</blockquote>

<p> Try out the controls on this panel - you can change the size of the atoms, display bonds, multiple unit cells etc etc.

<hr>

<p><br>Give the current model a suitable name. This will be used as the
label for this model in subsequent GULP simulations.
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>
  Edit -> Model -> Name<br>
  Change "Model_1(MgO.str)" to something suitable; say "MgO".
</blockquote>

<p><br>Note:
<blockquote>
 For the change to take effect you must press Return.<br>
 You'll see the name of the graphics window change to "DLV 3DView - MgO";
</blockquote>

<p><br>Now open the Execute GULP panel.
<blockquote>
 Calculate -> GULP -> Execute GULP
</blockquote>

<p>This panel will pop up;

<br>&nbsp; 
<p><img SRC="Execute1.gif"  BORDER=0 height=328 width=408 >
<br>&nbsp;

<p>As a first step GULP will be used to compute the energy per unit cell of MgO.

<p>The symmetry of the crystal fixes the positions of the atoms within
the cell and constrains the cell to be cubic. Thus, one the symmetry
is given the whole structure is determined by the positions of the two
atoms in the unit cell and the value of the lattice constant <i>a</i>.


<p>In order to compute the energy we must choose a <i>force field</i> 
or <i>potential model</i> to describe the interactions between the Mg 
and O ions. 

<blockquote>
 <p>Click on <b>Select potentials</b>
 <p>Select <b>ionic.lib</b> on the <b>GULP Potential parameters</b> panel
 <p>Ensure that the <b>Include Shells</b> option is <i>NOT</i> selected
</blockquote>

<p> This is a simple force field for MgO - the Mg ion is given a charge of
+2e, the O ion -2e and a simple Buckingham repulsive potential operates
between the ions. A good article for further reading about such force fields
is <br>
T.S.Bush, J.D.Gale, C.R.A.Catlow and P.D. Battle <i> J. Mater
Chem.</i>, <b>4</b>, 831-837 (1994) <br>


<p> Now you can run the calculation

<blockquote>
 <p>Select <b>Single Point</b> on the <b>Execute GULP</b> panel 
 <p>Click on <b>Run</b>
</blockquote>

<p>The <b>Job List</b> panel will open automatically and look something like this;

<br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;
<img SRC="JobList1.gif" BORDER=0 height=528 width=308>
<br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;

<p STYLE="font-weight: medium">Select the job and the status line should
report "Job has completed" - like this; <br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
<img SRC="JobList2.gif" BORDER=0 height=528 width=308>
<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;

<blockquote>
 <p>Click on <b>Recover Files</b>.
</blockquote>

<p>A window will open displaying the output from the GULP calculation 
(the <b>LogFile</b>). 

<p>It should look something like&nbsp; <a href="MgO_0.txt">MgO_0.txt</a>

<p>Take some time to read through the LogFile.

<hr>

<h2>Notes: </h2>

<p>To describe a crystal structure it is necessary to specify a box
called the <i>unit cell</i> which is repeated in order to create the 
<i>periodic lattice</i>. <br>

<blockquote>
 <p>In the LogFile GULP describes MgO using a <i>primitive unit cell</i>. 
   The cell vectors of this cell are (in Angstrom);

 <p>0.0000 &nbsp 2.10597 &nbsp 2.10597<br>
    2.10597 &nbsp 0.0000 &nbsp 2.10597<br>
    2.10597 &nbsp 2.10597 &nbsp 0.0000<br>

 <p>These vectors form a rhombohedron of side 2.9783 Angstrom and internal angle 60 degrees. 

 <p>The same lattice may also be described by a crystallagraphic
 (conventional) cell which is a cube of side 4.212  Angstrom (the
 <i>lattice constant</i>).<br> 
 You  can see the two cells using the <b>Display->Structure</b> panel.<br>
 Turn on draw lattice and select either <b>Primitive</b> or
 <b>Conventional</b> as the cell type.<br> 
</blockquote>

 <p> The primitive cell of MgO is a rhombohedron and is the smallest cell that an be used to 
 generate the crystal, the conventional cell has four times the volume but is a cube
 and better reflects the true symmetry of MgO - most crystallograhic studies will refer to
 this cell. <br>

<blockquote>
 <p> Turn on <b>label lattice</b> to see the <b>a</b>, <b>b</b> and
 <b>c</b> lattice vectors labels.<br> 
</blockquote>

You can build the lattice of MgO by repeating either cell.

<blockquote>
 <p> Use the <b>na</b>, <b>nb</b> and <b>nc</b> sliders on the
 <b>Display->Structure</b> panel to draw multiple cells.<br> 
</blockquote>

<p>After describing the structure the LogFile reports the interaction potentials 
that describe the Mg-O bonding (under the headings "Species output"
and "interatomic potentials"). Then the total energy due to the
inter-atomic forces (both short range repulsions and electrostatic
interactions) by summing over the infinite lattice. This energy should
be -41.07531759 electron-Volts (or eV)  per primitive unit cell; it is the 
"binding energy" of the crystal - ie: the energy required to pull all of the 
ions of the crystal to infinite separation.

<hr>

In the next exercise you will compute the vibrations of the lattice -
which are generally referred to as <i>phonons</i>.
