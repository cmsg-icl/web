 <h1>The Free Energy and Thermal Expansion of MgO</h1>
</center>

<hr>
<h2>Instructions: Spring 2007</h2>

<p> The following exercises are to be completed in the computational
laboratory and reports handed in to Miss Lisa Benbow in 442 by 4pm on the
on the dates indicated. Work submitted late will be penalised. <br>
Note that during scheduled sessions the computational laboratory is 
reserved solely for your use. <br>

<p>Group B: 5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> February; deadline 4pm
09/02. <br>

<p>Group A: 26<sup>th</sup> February to 2<sup>nd</sup> March; deadline 4pm
02/03. <br>

<p> In each exercise there are a number of explicit <i>Questions</i> and
often also an opportunity to <i>Speculate</i> on the results obtained.
The final report will be expected to contain answers to these questions
and, where you feel able, further speculation.

<p> Questions related to this computational experiment can be directed
to

<h2>Introduction & Background Material</h2>

<p>  The properties of materials (solids, liquids, gasses)  are a
  statistical average over the many different energy states of the
  molecules making up the material. In Problem Class 2 you computed
  the vibrational free energy of H<sub>2</sub> analytically by summing
  over the harmonic vibrations of the molecule. This cannot be done by
  hand for a real material containing many atoms. 

<p> In this laboratory
  you will use a simple model of atomic interactions to calculate the
  energy and vibrations of a crystal of MgO. These vibrational energy
  levels will then be used to compute the free energy of the crystal
  and to predict how the material expands when heated. In the last
  final stage you will go beyond the harmonic approximation and expand
  the crystal using a technique called molecular dynamics -
  essentially reproducing the actual vibration motions of the
  atoms. Fortunately the computer will do most of the work !

<p>  You should ensure that you are familiar with the contents of the 
  fourth lecture of the theoretical methods course before attempting
  the laboratory -

<h2>The Software: RedHat Linux, DLVisualize and GULP</h2>

<p>DLVisualize is a general purpose graphical user interface for
modelling. It will give you relatively easy access to a number of 
quantum mechanical and empirical simulation codes. In this case 
the interface to the molecular modelling code GULP 
(General Utility Lattice Program)  will be used. 

<p>Linux provides an excellent environment for numerical
simulations so the first step is to reboot your computer into RedHat 
Linux.

<p>The environment is not hugely dissimilar to that provided by Microsoft Windows.
You will find a web browser (Mozilla) on the tool bar and under the Start Menu you
will find some office tools (Writer, Math etc.) which are similar to those in
Microsoft Office (Word, Excel etc.) and you may find them useful in plotting your
data and writing your report.

<h3>Starting DLVisualize</h3>

<ul>

 <li> Open a terminal - right mouse click on the background, select Open Terminal </li>

 <li> In the terminal run the command <b>source /opt/chemistry/crystal/thermlab_setup </b> <br>
      This sets up the environment you need to use DLViz </li> 

 <li> type <b>dlv</b> to start DLViz </li>

</ul>


<p> There are web sites devoted to both DLV and GULP where you can find
some additional information.

   <a href="http://www.cse.clrc.ac.uk/cmg/DLV/">DLV</a>

<h2>Exercises</h2>

<p> The exercises below should be completed in sequence. Although there will be supervisors 
present during the laboratory the exercises are designed to facilitate self study - there
are many extensions of the exercises that might occur to you !
