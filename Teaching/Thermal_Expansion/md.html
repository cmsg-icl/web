<h2>Molecular Dynamics</h2>

<h3> Some Background </h3>

<p> As discussed in the lectures <i>Molecular Dynamics</i> is a
technique for allowing a system to evolve in time according to
Newton's second law F=ma. The atoms simply follow the trajectories
that they would in reality and we can then compute properties as
time averages of their behaviour. 

<p> MD is implemented as follows,

<p>First of all an initial configuration and initial velocities need to
be assigned - here the initial configuration will be that of ideal MgO
and the velocities will be random but scaled to produce roughly the
target temperature. Then ...

<ul>
 <li> Compute the forces on the atoms (F).
 <li> Compute the accelerations a=F/m
 <li> Update the velocities: Vnew = Vold + a * dt
 <li> Update the positions of the atoms: Rnew = Rold + Vnew * dt
 <li> Repeat until average properties like E and T settle down
 <li> Once settled measure some properties.
</ul>
  
<p> A crucial parameter here is the timestep <i>dt</i> - this needs to be
long enough for the calculation to be efficient but short enough for
all of the possible vibrations of the atoms to be sampled reasonably
well - typically you want about 10 steps along any given
vibration. For MgO a time step of 1 femtosecond (10<sup>-15</sup>
sec.) seems to be adequate.

<p> The other key issue is the <i>size</i> of the system to be
simulated. In the previous investigations you have seen that MgO can
be described by a primitive cell containing a single MgO unit (the
assymetric unit). However, running MD on this cell would be
meaningless - every cell of the crystal would be moving perfectly in
phase which is not physical. In fact, using a single unit cell is just
the same as sampling the phonons at just the <b>k</b>=(0,0,0) point -
this is the point at which all cells are in phase. 

<p> If we doubled the cell along all three cell vectors to obtain a
2x2x2 cell we would have a cell containing 8 MgO units within which
all of the vibrations sampled on a 2x2x2 <b>k</b>-point grid can be 
represented. The choice of cell size for MD can be established
empirically simply by running larger and larger cells but MD is much
more expensive than using the quasi-harmonic approximation so that is not
practical in this laboratory. As a compromise between accuracy and
efficiency a cell containing 32 MgO units will be used - this has
already been created and is stored in <i>MgO_32.str</i>.

<p> Note: The 32 unit MgO cell describes exactly the same static system as
the primitive cell - it simply allows more flexibility when the system
is vibrating.


<h3> Running MD Simulations </h3>

<blockquote>

 <p> Load the MgO_32.str structure - check that it is simply the same
 MgO crystal but represented in a larger cell (eg: check Mg-O bond
 distances by selecting neighbouring Mg and O ions and checking the
 report in the main window).

 <p> Open the <b>Execute Gulp</b> panel and select <b>Molecular
 Dynamics</b>.

 <p>Open the <b>MD Opts </b> panel and edit the MD options...

 <p> Set <b> ensemble </b> to <b>NPT</b>   -  in this simulation we fix
 the number of particles (N), the external pressure (P) and the
 temperature (T) while allowing the volume of the system (V) to vary.

 <p> Set the <b>Temperature</b> - initially use 300 K

 <p> Set the <b> Time Step </b> = 1.0 femtoseconds

 <p> Set the number of <b> Equilibration steps </b> to 500. 

 <p> <b> Production Steps </b> = 500 ; this is the number of steps
 run after equilibration is complete.

 <p> Set <b> Sampling steps </b> and <b> Trajectory write steps </b>
 to 5. These are, the number of time steps over which averages are made
 and, the number of steps betweem each writing of the geometry to a
 trajectory file for animations, respectively.

 <p> Make sure that you have selected ionic.lib for the potential model,
 that the <b>Include Shells</b> option is <i>NOT</i> selected,
 and that the DOS calculations are turned off under general options.
 Click <b>Run</b> to start the calculation.

</blockquote> 

<h3> The results </h3>

 <p> You can monitor the progress of the job by selecting it in the
 job list and recovering files whenever it says that the output file
 has changed.


 <p> Take a look at the Logfile. You will see the start of the MD
 equilibration when properties begin to be reported at each sampled
 time step (every 5 in the current job).

<p> At each timestep the <i>instantaneous</i> and <i>Averaged</i>
values of a number of properties are reported. You will see that the
cell structure and its volume <i>fluctuate</i> from timestep to
timestep but as the system settles down (<i>equilibrates</i>) the
averaged value becomes more stable. A good sign is that the
temperature becomes reasonably stable at around 300 K - if it doesn't
then the equations of motion are not being integrated accurately and a
smaller timestep is needed. 

<p> This is a relatively small cell and so fluctuations are quite
large however after the system has equilibrated you should be able to
identify an average cell volume (plus or minus a bit) for the
temperature.

<p> You can animate the movements of the ions for the production
steps.

<blockquote>

<p> <b>Display -> Animate -> Sequence </b>

</blockquote>

<p> Note: you can use the Display->structure to alter how the
structure looks while it is being animated. 

<p> Note: The MD runs take a look time to complete. You can get
together with other groups to run different temperatures - machines
can be left running overnight (put a note on the keyboard to ensure
that the machine isn't rebooted).

<h3>Questions</h3>

<ul>

 <li> Replot your data from the quasi-harmonic approximation calculations
 as,  cell volume per formula unit vs temperature, and add some points
 from the MD runs at a few suitable temperatures.

 <li> How does the thermal expansion predicted by MD compare to that
 predicted by the quasi-harmonic approximation ?

 <li> Why do the two methods produce different answers ? - how does the
 difference depend on temperature ?

</ul>

<h3>An opportunity to speculate</h3>
<ul>

 <li> From your experience of computing an accurate Free Energy how
 large a cell should be used to perform reliably MD for MgO ?

 <li> What would happen to the cell volume at high temperature in the
 quasi-harmonic approximation and in the MD ?
 

</ul>
